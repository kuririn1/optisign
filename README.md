veryfing that testimonials/prodcut reviews are real, giving endorsements, article apporvals by the editor that anyone can verify, pools, poof of reading and more.
In the future it could also work for example with Optimism AttestationStation.

Widget is in /html/index.html The current version is hardcoded (and made without centralized server), because of limited time during hackathon. 

Demo could be seen here: https://bafkreia2isxhiwe6r3seerlbur5sjfczitd5pwdr33tew23rqlpnzhskz4.ipfs2.eth.limo/ It works on Optimism Goerli testnet.
