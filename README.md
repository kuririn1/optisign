# optisign

OptiSign is a simple PoC (Proof of Concept) of a widget that could verify messages of ENS names or wallets. In the final form it could be used for signing credos, documents, petitions,
veryfing that testimonials/prodcut reviews are real, giving endorsements, article apporvals by the editor that anyone can verify, pools, poof of reading and more.
In the future it could also work for example with Optimism AttestationStation. It's deployed on Arbitrum, Avalanche and Optimism testnets.

Widget is in /html/ folder (arbitrum.html, avalanche.html, optimism.html for each chain) The current version is hardcoded (and made without centralized server), because of limited time during the hackathon. 

## Demos

For Arbitrum Goerli: 
For Avalanche Fuji: 
For Optimism Goerli: https://bafkreia2isxhiwe6r3seerlbur5sjfczitd5pwdr33tew23rqlpnzhskz4.ipfs2.eth.limo/ 

It could be used with ?content= param to provide different content for signing.
